# UnknownGameClient
The Client for the Unknown Multiplayer Arcade Game

## Update
This client version is depricated and being rebuilt using a redux-based architecture. This is due to insecurities of using session storage to maintain a global state. Other issues included the flux framework being difficult to write supporting tests. I'll add a reference once the new repository is up!
